## Certificate Generation Process

1. **Prepare Your Template**

    - Create a certificate template with space for text and QR code
    - Convert the template to SVG format using tools like [Pixelied PNG to SVG Converter](https://pixelied.com/convert/png-converter/png-to-svg)

2. **Setup GitHub Repository**

    - Create a new public repository on GitHub
    - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
    - Configure Pages to use the main branch and `/docs` folder

3. **Generate Certificates**

    - Enter your GitHub details to generate the base URL
    - Upload your certificate template
    - Import recipient data from Excel
    - Generate certificates with QR codes
    - Download the generated `docs` folder

4. **Deploy Certificates**
    - Upload the generated `docs` folder to your GitHub repository
    - Certificates will be accessible via GitHub Pages
    - QR codes will link to verification pages

## Verification Process

1. Scan the QR code on any certificate
2. The QR code links to a unique verification page
3. The verification page displays certificate authenticity and details
